less - Output file but just little bit at a time. Use this one. Not more.
Use /searchterm to search. It is the same command as in vim. n to scroll to next search result. Press q to quit.
more - Output file but just little bit at a time. less is better.

Working with files
touch - Create a new file.
cp - Copy
mkdir - Make directory.
mkdir -p  Make entire directory structure
rm - Remove file 
rm -rf  Remove recursively and its content. Very dangerous command!

Finding Files

Find 
Find is slower than locate but a lot more thorough. You can search for files recursively and with regex and a lot of other features.
# This will send all permissions denied outputs to dev/null.
find / -name file 2>/dev/null

Locate
Locate is really fast because it relies on an internal database. So in order to have it updated you need to run:
sudo updatedb

Then you can easily find stuff like this:
locate filename

Which
Outputs the path of the binary that you are looking for. It searches through the directories that are defined in your $PATH variable.
which bash
